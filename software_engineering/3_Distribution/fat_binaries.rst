Fat binaries
------------

Standalone self-contained applications or installers.

- Include Python interpreter and all dependencies.
- Fits Windows and MacOS application distribution, as unlike Linux they lack a dependency management tools.

Beware:

- Fat binaries are fat (~150 Mb for projects involving GUIs).
- You are redistributing (many) other people's work, so take care about licenses
  (e.g., numpy compiled with Intel's Math Kernel Library).

------

Freezing
........

There is a number of tools to 'freeze' a Python application for distribution from an installation on a computer.

Principle:

- Analyze a script to find its dependencies (i.e., its imports).
- Collect all dependencies and python interpreter in a directory.
- Add a launcher and eventually bundle everything in a single file or installer.

Issues:

- Analysis can miss some hidden imports.
- All runtime dependencies must be included (including external libraries wrapped by Python packages).
- Data files cannot be guessed and need to be explicitly added.

Test the result on a different computer than the one used for packaging.

cx_Freeze
.........

`cx_Freeze <http://cx-freeze.readthedocs.org/>`_ extends ``distutils``.

It is cross-platform.

Install cx_Freeze: ``pip install cx_Freeze``.

------

cx_Freeze
.........

cx_setup.py:

.. code-block:: python

   from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

   build_exe_options = {
       'packages': [],
       'includes': [],
       'excludes': [],
       'include_files': []
   }

   if sys.platform == 'win32':
       build_exe_options['include_msvcr'] = True

   base = 'Win32GUI' if sys.platform == 'win32' else None

   setup(name='my_app',
         version='0.1',
         options={
             'build_exe': build_exe_options,
             'bdist_dmg': {'applications-shortcut': True}
         },
         executables=[Executables('my_app.py', base=base)])

------

cx_Freeze
.........

First install your package and its dependencies.

On Windows, run ``python cx_setup.py build_exe`` to build a directory with all required files.
Then you can create an installer with a tool such as `NSIS <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/>`_.

On MacOS, run ``python cx_setup.py bdist_dmg`` to build a .dmg with an .app included.

------

py2app
......

MacOS specific *freezing* tool.

py2app_setup.py:

.. code-block:: python

  from setuptools import setup

  setup(app=['my_app_script.py'],
        setup_requires=['py2app'],
        options={'py2app': {
            'argv_emulation': True,
            'packages': [],  # List of packages
            'iconfile': 'icon_file.icns',
        }}
  )

Run ``python py2app_setup.py py2app`` to build an application bundle ``.app`` in ``dist/``.

------

MacOS Application Bundle
........................

A MacOS application (``.app``) is a directory also called an *application bundle*.

It contains::

  App.app/
      Contents/
          Info.plist  -> Bundle configuration file (XML)
          MacOS/      -> Contains the executable file
          Resources/  -> Application resources
          Frameworks/ -> frameworks: dynamic libraries and there resources
          ...

See `bundle doc <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/BundleTypes/BundleTypes.html>`_.

Sum-up
......

Different tools to freeze.

Main issue: Making sure it is stand-alone and includes everything required.
