    "\n",
    "**Usage**  \n",
    "This is used when a *single* class (instance) is needed by all the components of a system.\n",
    "  - Example: shared data/configuration across modules.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Subclassing is a problem with singletons\n",
    "  - Python modules are intrisically singletons !\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**  \n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, all instances have their own attributes/methods stored in the `__dict__` dictionary.  \n",
